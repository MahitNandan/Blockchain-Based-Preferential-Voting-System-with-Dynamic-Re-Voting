# Blockchain Based Preferential Voting System with Dynamic Re-Voting

## Abstract
In an era where trust in electoral systems is crucial, traditional voting methods often struggle to ensure fairness, transparency, and efficiency. Ranked choice voting (RCV) addresses some of these issues by allowing voters to express preferences beyond a simple binary choice, thereby ensuring that the elected candidate has broader support. However, RCV is not without its challenges, including potential vote manipulation and inefficient tallying processes.

This paper introduces a groundbreaking approach that integrates blockchain technology with ranked choice voting, leveraging Ethereumâ€™s decentralized platform to overcome the vulnerabilities of conventional voting systems. By utilizing smart contracts, our system automates the vote tallying process, redistributes votes during candidate eliminations, and ensures that all votes are securely cast and transparently recorded.

The decentralization of the voting process through blockchain technology significantly reduces the potential for fraud and manipulation, thereby enhancing voter confidence and trust. This innovative solution not only streamlines the voting process but also provides a robust framework for ensuring the integrity of election outcomes.

The paper outlines the implementation, methodology, and advantages of blockchain-based ranked choice voting, demonstrating how it can revolutionize election processes for a new era of digital democracy. By combining the strengths of RCV with the security and transparency of blockchain, this approach offers a promising path forward for more reliable and trustworthy electoral systems.
